                        A white, grainy-looking fluid in a round bottle that causes everything the drinker consumes for the next few hours to taste like sugarcane. However, the potion itself tastes like cough syrup mixed with sand. Unfortunately, the potion's effects do not do anything to change this.

                       A cute, pink little potion with an orange ribbon around the neck of the bottle. Tastes like peaches and cream.
