	<p class="name">Clearsight</p>
	<p class="dosage">10s - Duration: 1d - Suggested Dosage: 1 bottle</p>

	<p class="dosage">10s - Duration: Permanent* -  Suggested Dosage: ½ bottle</p>
	<p class="description">Reduces the amount of fel corruption in one's body by a slight amount. Does not reverse/reduce any fel-induced body growths such as horns, glowing eyes, or tails. Tastes like vegetable oil, but is not actually oily in the slightest.</p>

	<p class="description">A pinkish potion in a flat bottle, suitable for being put into a pocket. Acts as a painkiller that reduces physical or mental pain for roughly eight hours.

	<p class="description">A (troll) finger-sized potion, containing a clear liquid. Can be poured on an open wound, and will cause the skin to stitch back together. Mileage varies on the size of the wound. Works on Forsaken flesh as well, but cannot reconnect limbs. Also works internally for any sort of gastro-intestinal injury, but tastes awful.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="options">

	<p class="description">A reddish, syrup-like liquid, in a traditional cylindrical bottle. Tastes approximately like fruit. Reduces cough, fever, and other cold/flu symptoms. Makes you feel wide awake but exhausted once it wears off.. whenever that is. Downing the suggested serving feels like you've been jabbed in the throat with a sharp quill, however.</p>

	<p class="dosage">10s - Duration: 6h - Suggested Dosage: ⅓ bottle</p>
	<p class="description">A dark blue potion in a teardrop-shaped bottle. Water will simply roll off of whatever the potion is poured onto-- and the potion itself will not stain or otherwise discolor anything once poured. Ideal for those that need to take flight in rainy weather, such as bird-based or insect-based races.</p>
	</div>

	<p class="name">Vaporweight</p>
	<p class="dosage">5s - Duration: 1h - Suggested Dosage: 1 mouthful</p>

	<p class="dosage">10s - Duration: 6h - Suggested Dosage: 1 bottle</p>
	<p class="description">A purple potion in an ice-pack-shaped bottle. At room temperature, it has the consistency of syrup, and does nothing. When heated, it becomes more watery, and comfortably warms the drinker's entire body for several hours. When chilled, it becomes more akin to a slushie and cools the drinker's body for the same amount of time. Tastes like tap water.</p>
	</div>

	<p style="float: left;"><img src="/startusk/i/freshair.png"></p>
	<p class="name">Fresh Air</p>
	<p class="dosage">5s  - Duration: 1h - Suggested Dosage: 1 full inhale</p>
	<p class="description">A bottle with a strange, steaming liquid inside. It is not meant to be sipped from; simply take in as full of a breath as you can of the minty vapor within, and it will clear your airways for a short while. Useful for heavily clogged sinuses.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="options">
	<p style="float: left;"><img src="/startusk/i/artificialsweetener.png"></p>

	<p class="dosage">5s - Duration: 5h - Suggested Dosage: 1 spoonful</p>
	<p class="description">A white, grainy-looking fluid in a round bottle that causes everything the drinker consumes for the next few hours to taste like sugarcane. However, the potion itself tastes like cough syrup mixed with sand. Unfortunately, the potion's effects do not do anything to change this.</p>
	</div>

	<p class="name">Reversal Elixir</p>
	<p class="dosage">10s - Duration: 1.5h - Suggested Dosage: 1 bottle</p>
	<p class="description">A purple-and-yellow potion that swirls endlessly, but the colors never blend. Enables those sensitive to Light to be sensitive to Void instead, and vice versa. Not recommended for consumption by certain races due to unpredictable results. </p>

	<p style="float: left;"><img src="/startusk/i/blushbrew.png"></p>
	<p class="name">Blush Brew</p>
	<p class="dosage">20s - Duration: 5h - Suggested Dosage: ½ bottle</p>
	<p class="description">A cute, pink little potion with an orange ribbon around the neck of the bottle. Tastes like peaches and cream. When consumed, the drinker will feel fluttery and happy, similar to the dopamine rush one can get when they see their crush. Effects are enhanced if the potion is gently heated first. </p>
	</div>

	<div class="options">
	<p style="float: left;"><img src="/startusk/i/foxfire.png"></p>
	<p class="name">Foxfire Deluxe</p>
	<p class="dosage">5s - Duration: 6h - Suggested Dosage: ½ bottle</p>
	<p class="description">An orange bottle with a red liquid inside. Tastes like cinnamon candy. Drinking it causes you to sprout an orange, translucent fox tail.

	<p class="name">Stinkbug</p>
	<p class="dosage">1s - Duration: 45m - Suggested Dosage: 1 bottle</p>
	<p class="description">A small bottle with a green fluid inside. Drinking it makes your breath smell like death warmed over. Effect only works once ingested; could be poured into a drink or dish without notice if not for the fact it's so offensively green in color.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="options">
	<p style="float: left;"><img src="/startusk/i/nightsedge.png"></p>
	<p class="name">Night's Edge </p>
	<p class="dosage">15s - Duration: 10h - Suggested Dosage: 1 sip</p>
	<p class="description">A sparkling bluish-purple (or purplish-blue?) elixir that tastes oddly like a fine wine, but without the actual alcohol involved. Upon ingestion, the drinker's perception of the sky will change to that of a star-lit evening, and even feel a cooler breeze wash over their form as if the change in time had been real. Instills a calming effect. </p>
	</div>

	<div class="options">
	<p style="float: left;"><img src="/startusk/i/nullnvoid.png"></p>

	<p class="description">A black, crescent-shaped bottle with a black liquid inside. Tastes like how sleep deprivation feels. Fifteen minutes after drinking, you will fall into a deep, 8-hour slumber in which nothing can awaken you, not even your own nightmares. You will not forget them when you wake up. But you'll feel rested, otherwise!</p>

	<p style="float: left;"><img src="/startusk/i/bugjuice.png"></p>
	<p class="name">Bug Juice</p>
	<p class="dosage">1s - Duration: 45m - Suggested Dosage: 1 bottle</p>
	<p class="description">A tiny yellow potion that tastes like leaves. Causes the imbiber to have their butt replaced with a random insect abdomen. Mantids, beetles, ants, grubs-- you name it, you can have a butt of it. Why? Why not. Bug butt time.</p>
